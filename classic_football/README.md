# SEI-Project-1 | Classic Football

Game Description:
GOAL: Move the offensive player past the defenders to the far (right) endzone to accumulate as many touchdowns as possible in the allotted number of turns. Get tackled by a defender and lose that turn.

Game is meant to be played with two players, each taking turns to score more touchdowns than the other! Press any of the three buttons to get started.


Background: 
"Classic Football" is based on the handheld Mattel Electronics video game that I would play when I was younger (although it was first released in 1977). The objective of the game is to move your player from the left-hand side of the screen to the rightside endzone without running into contact with any of the five defenders. Your player has the options of moving up or down one spot or forward - no going backwards. The key to this game is to time when the defenders are moving so as to be able to avoid them as quickly as possible and make it to the endzone. Typically played against the computer, the game is given a set timer and whoever scores the most amount of touchdowns in that alloted time wins. 

My game: 
My idea was to replicate this - although unsuccessfully. My plan was to substitute the timer with a given amount of turns, although this was something I was not able to develop functionality with. Playing this game with two people, whoever has the higher amount of points at the end would then be the winner. Just as in the original game, the player starts backed up against their own endzone and must make it across the field without running into any defenders on the way. In the likely scenario that this does happen, the player would be stopped and it would then be the opposing player's turn (not what happens in the Mattel game but that's okay).
